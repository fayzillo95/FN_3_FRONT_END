                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects <br>
                    I learned were current, if not more so, in the company <br>
                    I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth. <br>

                    I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a <br>
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br>
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've <br>
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. <br>

                    Before joining the bootcamp, I've<br>
                    never written a line of code. I needed<br>
                    some structure from professionals<br>
                    who can help me learn programming<br>
                    step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
                    enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
                    who can only say wonderful things<br>
                    about the program. The entire<br>
                    curriculum and staff did not<br>
                    disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
                    and I never had to wait long for<br>
                    assistance. The agile team project, in<br>
                    particular, was outstanding. It took<br>
                    my learning to the next level in a way<br>
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>
                    fact, I've often referred to it during<br>
                    interviews as an example of my<br>
                    development experience. It certainly<br>
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>
                    developer after receiving multiple<br>
                    offers. 100% recommend!
