I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects 
I learned were current, if not more so, in the company 
I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.


I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 
weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

The team was 
very supportive and kept me 
motivated 

I started as a total newbie with 
virtually no coding skills. I now work 
as a mobile engineer for a big 
company. This was one of the best 
investments I've made in myself.

Such a life-changing 
experience. Highly 
recommended!

<p>" Before joining the bootcamp, I've<br>
never written a line of code. I needed<br>
some structure from professionals<br>
who can help me learn programming<br>
step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
who can only say wonderful things<br>
about the program. The entire<br>
curriculum and staff did not<br>
disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
and I never had to wait long for<br>
assistance. The agile team project, in<br>
particular, was outstanding. It took<br>
my learning to the next level in a way<br>
that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>
fact, I've often referred to it during<br>
interviews as an example of my<br>
development experience. It certainly<br>
helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>
developer after receiving multiple<br>
offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
